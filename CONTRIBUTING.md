# Contributing

So you want to contribute to the KKBot: Great! Please use the issue templates that are already provided. Or if you're one of those who would like to do stuff the hard way, there are a couple of things you need to know before you get started.

## Correcting mistakes/reporting bugs

If you would like to correct a mistake or report a bug, please follow these steps:

1. Make an issue for the mistake or bug in the format `[BUG] Descriptive but short title`.

2. (_Optional_) If you know how to fix the error, make a descriptively named branch in the format `bug-name-of-bug`. _Please no spaces in the branch name :)_

3. (_Optional_) In the branch you just created, edit the file, and make a PR for the branch.

4. In the branch PR, reference the Issue, and in the issue, reference the PR.

After that, all you have to do is wait, and the maintainers will see what they can do!

## Adding features

If you would like to make or suggest a new feature, these are the steps to follow:

1. Make a descriptively named issue in the format of `[FEATURE] name of feature`, and someone will help you out

   For example, if i wanted to add a divide command, this is what my title would be: `[FEATURE] Divide command`

2. (_Optional_) If you know how to add the feature, make a new branch with the format `feature-name-of-feature`. _Please dont use spaces in the branch name :)_

3. (_Optional_) In the branch you just created, make a change, and then make a PR for the branch.

4. In the branch PR, reference the Issue, and in the issue, reference the PR
